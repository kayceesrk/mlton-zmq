You can compile MLton with <a href="SMLNJ">SML/NJ</a>, however the resulting compiler will run much more slowly than MLton compiled by itself.  We don't recommend using SML/NJ as a means of  <a href="PortingMLton">porting MLton to a new platform</a> or bootstrapping on a new platform.  <p>
If you do want to build MLton with SML/NJ, it is best to have a binary MLton package installed.  If you don't, here are some issues you may encounter when you run <tt>make&nbsp;nj-mlton</tt>. 
</p>
<p>
You will get (many copies of) the error message: 
</p>

<pre>/bin/sh: mlton: not found</pre><p>
The <tt>Makefile</tt> calls <tt>mlton</tt> to determine dependencies, and can proceed in spite of this error.  
</p>
<p>
If you don't have a <tt>mlton</tt> executable, you will get the error message:  
<pre>Error: cannot upgrade basis because the compiler doesn't work</pre>
</p>
<p>
We use <tt>upgrade-basis.sml</tt> to work around basis library differences, allowing a version of MLton written for a newer basis library to be compiled by an older version of MLton.  The file isn't necessary when building with SML/NJ, but is listed in <tt>$(SOURCES)</tt>, so the <tt>Makefile</tt> is attempting to build it. Building <tt>upgrade-basis.sml</tt> requires the old version of MLton to be around so that the right stubs can be built. 
</p>
<p>
To work around this problem, do one of the following. 
</p>

        <ul>

        <li>
<p>
 Manually tweak sources to remove $(UP) until you're finished   building MLton with SML/NJ and have a working MLton. 
</p>
</li>
        <li class="gap">
<p>
 Build <tt>upgrade-basis.sml</tt> on some other machine with a working   MLton and copy it over. 
</p>
</li>

        </ul>


<p>
If you don't have an <tt>mllex</tt> executable, you will get the error message: 
<pre>mllex: Command not found</pre>
</p>
<p>
Building MLton requires <tt>mllex</tt> and <tt>mlyacc</tt> executables, which are distributed with a binary package of MLton.  The easiest solution is to copy the front-end lexer/parser files from a different machine  (<tt>ml.grm.sml</tt>, <tt>ml.grm.sig</tt>, <tt>ml.lex.sml</tt>, <tt>mlb.grm.sig</tt>, <tt>mlb.grm.sml</tt>).
